HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT HERE!

Required:
 [ ]Visual Appeal:
	[ ]	Design your project to be visually appealing; follow industry trends.
	[ ]	Aim to create projects that employers find attractive and engaging.
	[ ]	Select a color palette and font stack to enhance design consistency.

[ ]Database Interaction:
	[ ]Develop at least one class (excluding the default class in a new project),
create an object of that class, populate it with data from a database, and incorporate the data in
your application. A minimum of 1 table (entity) should be utilized. Note that classes should be
created even when using object relational mappers like Entity Framework.

[ ]Functions/Methods: 
Create and utilize a minimum of 3 functions or methods, with at least one
returning a value integral to your application.

Features:  ** Use THREE of these**

[ ]Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program

[ ]Make a generic class and use it

[ ]Have 2 or more tables (entities) in your application that are related and have a function return data from both entities.  In entity framework, this is equivalent to a join

[ ]Query your database using a raw SQL query, not EF

[ ]Create 3 or more unit tests for your application

[ ]Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file
